# k-po-mode

A po-mode fork.

I first forked since po-mode gave me “a bunch of errors” (I wrote that but I don't remember what errors) and I patched it enough that it works.

Right now I'm playing with adding Lokalize-like features, such as project (or language)-wide translation memory.

Changes are made for translation. po-mode had support for marking strings for translating in program source buffers, which is a problem that's better solved elsewhere, so I removed it in this fork.
