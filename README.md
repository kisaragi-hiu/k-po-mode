# k-po-mode

A po-mode fork.

Changes are made for translation, while .po file management features (like those allowing you to extract strings from source files) will be removed.

I first forked since po-mode gave me “a bunch of errors” (I wrote that but I don't remember what errors) and I patched it enough that it works.

Right now I'm playing with adding Lokalize-like features, such as project (or language)-wide translation memory.
