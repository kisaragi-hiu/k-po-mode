;;; Commentary:

;; I don't know why po-mode from
;; https://github.com/emacsmirror/po-mode/ gave me a bunch of errors,
;; so instead of figuring it out I'm just going to patch it so that it
;; works.
;;
;; I'm also interested in adding multi-file project-wide translation features in
;; here.

(require 'f)
(require 'eieio)

(require 'k-po-entry)
(require 'k-po-sidebar)
(require 'k-po-memory)
